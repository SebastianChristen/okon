          <img src="./team1.jpg" style="width: 30%; min-width: 300px; float: left; margin: 20px" />

          <p>
            Once upon a digital frontier, a visionary by the name of SebuPro69 embarked on a remarkable journey. Born from a
            profound passion for innovation and driven by an insatiable desire to create, the seeds of Okon were sown. What
            started as a humble dream eventually bloomed into a thriving global entity that stands tall today.
          </p>

          <p>
            SebuPro69, a dynamic entrepreneur with a knack for combining the extraordinary, had an epiphany. He envisioned a
            company that blended the 'AWESOME' aspects of digital innovation with the unwavering 'COMMITMENT' to excellence. Thus,
            Okon, a name that resonated with the promise of remarkable experiences, was born.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a small startup in Japan, SebuPro69 and his dedicated team embarked on a quest to redefine the digital landscape.
            Their first creation, 'Awesite,' a web platform like no other, turned heads and set the bar for digital excellence. It
            became the talk of the town, a shining example of what passion, dedication, and ingenuity could achieve.
          </p>
          <img src="./team2.jpg" style="width: 30%; min-width: 300px; float: right; margin: 20px" />
          <p>
            With their sights set on expanding their global footprint, SebuPro69 strategically established a presence in
            Switzerland. The blend of Japanese precision and Swiss sophistication became a hallmark of Okon's offerings. This
            strategic move enabled them to access diverse markets, foster global collaborations, and bring their unique vision to
            a broader audience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Business boomed, and the world took notice of Okon's commitment to innovation and creativity. 'Awesite' became the
            gold standard for web experiences, and 'Worldaround,' their Minecraft server, grew into a thriving virtual community.
            But beyond the products, Okon was renowned for its unique mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            'Create, Don't Just Consume' became the mantra. The team at Okon inspired a generation to be creators, to craft, and
            to build. Their culture of innovation and 'can-do' spirit made them trailblazers in the industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, Okon stands as a testament to SebuPro69's visionary leadership and the collective efforts of a global team.
            From a dream born in the heart of Japan to a worldwide force to be reckoned with, Okon continues to inspire, create,
            and set the bar higher. Join us as we shape the digital future, one 'AWESOME' creation at a time.
